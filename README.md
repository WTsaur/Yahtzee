# Yahtzee

## Compiling and Running
*Note: Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed* 
1. Open up a terminal or command prompt and go to the Yahtzee folder
2. Run `yahtzee.sh`
> This will remove any .class files, compile all .java files, 
> move to the parent directory, create a `hwx.jar` file, 
> and run `hwx.jar` with the following command: `java -jar hwx.jar`

## How To Play The Game!
> Add players by typing a player name into the text box and clicking `Add Player` or by hitting the `enter` key.
> Remove all players from the list with the `Clear Players` button.
> Make sure you have at least 2 players (maximum of 10) and then hit the `Start Game` button to begin playing!


> A window will pop up letting you know whose turn it is.


> In the top left you can see whose turn it is and how many of their rolls they have used.


> Click the dice on the right hand side to make your first roll!


> Click on the dice to "lock" it in place so that they don't change while you re-roll some other dice!


> When you like what you have or have run out of rolls, head over to the scorecard!
> Here you can see a preview of what the score would look like on your card as well as your current totals based on your previous turns.
> `Select` a score if you think the number to the left of it is to your liking!
> `Mark as 0` if you don't like any of your options or if you don't think you'll get lucky with that particular type of roll.


> Lastly, click the pause button in the top right corner if you would like to restart the game or quit the game!
